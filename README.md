# LearningSQL
I am learning to use SQL from a class at the University of Texas at Dallas


This is the schema https://imgur.com/a/onZ6chh (also known as the planning) that I did to create the studentproject.


For the employee.sql file, this is the Entity Relationship diagram that I drew for it. There are some extra things, but I am trying to learn ER diagram by just conceptulizing extra stuff. But these extra things are not reflected in the employee.sql file.
